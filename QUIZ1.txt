PC Error/Trouble: PC won’t boot to BIOS

The problem of the computer system that we disassembled is that it won’t boot to BIOS eve if we press the “TAB” or “DEL” key.
The possible reasons for a faulting computer like this is that it might have a faulty RAM, so to solve this, try transferring it to another slot or replace it. Another thing that might be causing this is a faulty PCI card/s, also misplaced front panel connectors, so make sure to plug/connect the connectors properly on its assigned place. Another is a missing power supply cables or faulty power supply cables, so check if the 24-pin ATX cable and the 4-pin and 8-pin CPU connector on the motherboard if it is properly connected or not faulty. A dead CPU/Microprocessor might also be causing this error, so we have to replace it with another compatible microprocessor. Also a faulty PSU might be causing this error, so try to fix it and if it really can’t be fixed, replace it.
